        <p>This project seeks to address the injustice and grievances experienced by conflict-affected
women due to the impact of conflict. These injustices and grievances are not only limited to the
political space but in the social and economic spaces as well. For this, we want to build the
leadership of conflict-affected women and the network. Not only make them leaders in their
advocacy but also make them peace leaders with strong knowledge in conflict transformation,
peace building, and as well as in Transitional Justice issue.</p>
<p>The objectives of this project are to strengthen the movement building and advocacy of Conflict
Victim Women National Network (CVWN) in Nepal by promoting transformative peace
leadership and mental health, to increase the capacity of the communities and its local
infrastructures (schools, ward offices, municipalities, health posts, local organizations) to sustain
peace through peace initiatives like peace circles, peace education, medical support and
livelihood sustainability as well as understanding the transitional justice and reparation issues
with their accountability and to document, memorialize and share stories of women’s role in
armed conflict through oral-histories, evidence collection, and visual documentaries. Stories of
not only their multilayered traumas and struggles but also their strengths and initiatives during
the conflict period.</p>
<p>This project’s goal is to help address the long-term injustice and grievances of women affected
by prevailing structural violence through gender lens.</p>
