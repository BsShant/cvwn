            <p>Your contributions help us serve India’s most marginalized children and ensure that they are
               able to go to school, get proper nutrition and healthcare and stay protected from abuse and exploitation.
            </p>
            <p>We cannot do the work that we do without your support and it’ll need each and every one of us to come together
               to ensure happier childhoods for children everywhere!
            </p>
